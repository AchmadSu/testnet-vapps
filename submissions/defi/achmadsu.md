# vApp Proposal

## Title
DeTrust â€” Decentralized Will & Digital Inheritance Manager

## Description
DeTrust is a decentralized application (vApp) that allows users to securely store and automate the execution of digital wills using smart contracts. The will can be triggered under specific conditions such as wallet inactivity or third-party verification.

## Problem Statement
Many people don't prepare wills, or face legal and bureaucratic barriers when managing inheritance. With increasing ownership of digital assets, there's a growing need for automated, transparent, and secure solutions for inheritance.

## Solution
We use smart contracts to allow users to set up a digital will and assign beneficiaries. When certain conditions are met (e.g., no activity on wallet for X months), the contract will automatically execute the will and distribute the assets.

## Key Features
- Create a digital will securely
- Select and manage beneficiaries
- Automate execution based on wallet inactivity
- Store encrypted will content using IPFS + zk

## Target Users
- Long-term crypto holders
- Digital asset investors
- DAO contributors and founders

## Tech Stack
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- IPFS (Document Storage)
- zk-SNARKs (for private conditions)
- Ethereum Sepolia (Testnet)
- Next.js + RainbowKit (Frontend)

## Current Status
Working prototype (smart contract + basic UI done)

## Roadmap
- September 2025: Internal Testing
- October 2025: Beta Launch with user feedback
- December 2025: Public Release + Smart Contract Audit
